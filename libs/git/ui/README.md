# git-ui

This library is responsible for the application selection by the user.
The user will be able to see all available git repos and the app they relate to, and select an app to work on.

This library will handle the UI side and all the server calls to select, clone, and branch out the selected repository.

Later on, it will handle actions like revert, new branch, and potentially more.
